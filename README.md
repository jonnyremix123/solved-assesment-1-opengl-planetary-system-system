Task

Write an OpenGL program to create a simple planetary system using colour cubes to represent the

“planets”. The image in Figure I shows an example of this.




Construct the simple planetary system scene.

o The scene should consist of a large “sun” in the centre and four other “planets” that

orbit the sun. Note that your program should contain the vertex specification of a

single colour cube. The sun and the planets are to use the same vertex specification,

i.e. use transformations to alter the position, size and rotation.

0 Implement basic animation.

Each planet is to orbit the sun. In addition, each planet also rotates about its own

centre. The animation should be updated based on frame time, so that your program

updates consistently regardless of frame rate. The planetary orbits and rotation only

needs to be in the horizontal plane, i.e. rotation about the y-axis.

Allow the user to toggle animation by pressing “p” on the keyboard.
